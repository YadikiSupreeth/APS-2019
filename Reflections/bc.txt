Pascal_problem:
In_2D_matrix
    Its an DP problem were we store all the intermediate results
    It is good if we have many many queries
    But it occupy huge space in N is large

Reccursion
    It take longer time when compared to above one because same value will be calculated twice
    It may lead to stack overflow at some cases
    It is good if N is too small and If it is not a query problem

In_1D_array
    It is optimized version of 2D matrix as it reduces space
    But does not support querie problems
    Time is same in both the implementations
    It is same like a Reccursion avoiding dual call

So based on the type of problem constraints choose the best approperiate implementation
